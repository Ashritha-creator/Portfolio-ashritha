## 2. Build Admin Frontend Pages 🛠️

✅ Right now after login you only see a basic Admin page.  
✅ You need to add:

| Page | Route | Feature |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Add Project | `/admin/add-project` | Form to submit Project (Title, Description, Link) |
| Add Skill | `/admin/add-skill` | Form to submit Skill (Skill Name) |
| Add Blog | `/admin/add-blog` | Form to submit Blog (Title, Content) |

✅ These forms will POST data to your backend.

## 3. Polish UI and Design 🎨

✅ Your Admin dashboard should look nice!

- Add Tailwind CSS or use simple card-based layout
- Buttons, Success messages, Error alerts
- Admin navbar/sidebar for easy navigation

---

## 4. Deployment 🌎

✅ You should deploy:

| Part | Where |
|:---|:---|
| Frontend (Next.js) | Vercel |
| Backend (NestJS) | Render |

✅ Free accounts are enough for this!

# 🎯 Final Upgrade Plan:
